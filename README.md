## Introduction
Key-Aggregate Based Access Control Encryption for Flexible Cloud Data Sharing

## Build

### Compile
ul: make ul
udl: make udl
### Clean
make clean
### Environmental requirement
install the pbc library
## Use
The following takes the ul scheme as an example to show how to use it, and and the same for the udl scheme.

Open three terminals, where the first terminal represents TrustedAuthority, Server, Sanitizer, the second terminal represents ns senders, and the third terminal represents nr receivers.
* first terminal: ./output/ul 3 3 100 0
* second terminal: ./output/ul 3 3 100 1
* third terminal: ./output/ul 3 3 100 2

argv[0] denotes test program. argv[1] denotes the number of senders, argv[2] denotes the number of receivers, argv[3] denotes the number of files, argv[4] denotes parties, where 0 represents TrustedAuthority, Server, Sanitizer, 1 represents sender, and 2 represents receiver.

* After running, the result is as followsï¼š

## Notice
The access control policy can be accessed by modifying the utils.cpp:128, the access policy is now an upper triangle, i.e

0 -> 0

1 -> 0 1

2 -> 0, 1, 2
